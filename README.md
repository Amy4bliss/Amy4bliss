- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Management**: Excel, MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Featured Projects

- **KPMG Virtual Internship Project**: As part of my virtual internship with KPMG, I handled a dataset for a cycling company. My role involved writing SQL queries for data cleaning and analysis, followed by the creation of an interactive sales dashboard to visualize customer behavior and product performance.
